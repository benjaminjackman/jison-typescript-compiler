#jison-typescript-compiler (jtsc)
=========================
Jison Based Compiler for Typescript

## Motivation
- to create Jison Grammar rules to make it easy to parse Typescript files
- use the Jison parser to make a ts compiler that emits js as quickly as possible.


## Directions

### Building it yourself

Install nodejs & npm
(beyond the scope of this readme.md) but go (here)[http://nodejs.org/download/] to get started

Install grunt (a build tool for nodejs projects) globally
```
npm install -g grunt
```

Install the local dependencies under the project itself, these include things
like the plugins referenced in the grunt file and so on.

from within the root folder of your clone of this repo
```
npm install
```
